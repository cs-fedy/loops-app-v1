## 🏗️ Architecture

The project follows a **layered architecture** with clear separation of concerns:

```
src/
├── components/ui/          # Reusable UI components (Shadcn)
├── modules/               # Feature modules
│   ├── account-management/    # User account features
│   ├── authentication/        # Login, register, auth flows
│   ├── content-management/    # Content creation and management
│   ├── learning-experience/   # Core learning features
│   ├── shared/               # Shared utilities and services
│   └── user-onboarding/      # User onboarding flows
├── routes/               # Application routes
└── styles/              # Global styles
```

### Module Structure

Each module follows a consistent structure:

- `features/` - UI components and pages
- `services/` - API calls and business logic
- `types/` - TypeScript type definitions
- `hooks/` - Custom React hooks

### Shared Module

The shared module contains:

- `api/` - API configuration and interceptors
- `components/` - Reusable components
- `domain/` - Domain entities and models
- `guards/` - Route guards and middleware
- `navigation/` - Advanced navigation system with smart routing, completion tracking, and strategy-based content transitions (see `.trae/navigation-module-docs.md`)
- `services/` - Shared business logic
- `utils/` - Utility functions

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- Yarn package manager

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd loops-client
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables**

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

   Configure the following variables:

   ```env
   VITE_API_URL="http://localhost:8080/api"
   VITE_SESSION_SECRET_KEY="your-secret-key"
   ```

4. **Start the development server**

   ```bash
   yarn dev
   ```

   The app will be available at `http://localhost:3001`

### Available Scripts

- `yarn dev` - Start development server
- `yarn build` - Build for production
- `yarn lint:format` - Format code with Prettier
- `yarn lint:fix` - Fix ESLint issues
- `yarn test` - Run tests (when configured)

## 🔧 Development Guidelines

### Code Style

- **Language**: All code and comments in English
- **Naming**: camelCase for variables, PascalCase for React components
- **Files**: kebab-case for file names
- **Folders**: snake_case for folder names

### Architecture Principles

1. **Type Safety First**: Never use `any`, enforce strict typing
2. **Validation at Boundaries**: All API responses validated with Zod
3. **Effect Everywhere**: Use Effect package for error handling
4. **Layered Separation**: Clear separation between UI, routing, services
5. **Single Responsibility**: One file = one purpose

### Error Handling

- All API calls wrapped in **Effect** for typed error handling
- Structured error responses with `code`, `message`, and optional `payload`
- No unhandled promises or silent failures

### Testing

- Unit tests for hooks, services, and utilities
- Integration tests for API layer with mocked responses
- E2E tests for critical user flows
- Target ≥80% code coverage

## 📱 PWA Features

- **Offline Support**: Core functionality works without internet
- **Installable**: Can be installed on mobile devices and desktop
- **Background Sync**: Syncs data when connection is restored
- **Push Notifications**: Engagement through notifications (when implemented)
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for all screen sizes

## 🌍 Internationalization

The app supports multiple languages using React i18n:

- Default language: English
- Translation keys for all UI text
- RTL support ready
- Easy to add new languages

## 🔒 Security

- **Input Validation**: All inputs validated with Zod schemas
- **XSS Protection**: Sanitized user inputs
- **CSRF Protection**: Secure API communication
- **Secure Headers**: Security headers configured
- **Environment Variables**: Sensitive data in environment variables

## 🚀 Deployment

### Build for Production

```bash
yarn build
```

### Environment Setup

Ensure production environment variables are configured:

- `VITE_API_URL` - Production API endpoint
- `VITE_SESSION_SECRET_KEY` - Strong secret key for sessions

### PWA Deployment

The app automatically generates:

- Service worker for offline functionality
- Web app manifest for installation
- Optimized assets for different screen sizes

## 🤝 Contributing

1. Follow the established code style and architecture
2. Write tests for new features
3. Update documentation as needed
4. Use conventional commit messages (`feat:`, `fix:`, `refactor:`)
5. Ensure all linting and formatting passes
